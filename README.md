🧑‍💻 Freelance System

A lightweight freelance platform designed to connect clients with skilled freelancers, enabling remote work, online hiring, and proposal management in a simple and efficient way.

📌 Project Overview

With the growing popularity of remote work, many tasks can now be completed from anywhere. This Freelance System automates the hiring workflow between Clients who post jobs and Freelancers who submit proposals.

The system includes user authentication, job posting, proposal tracking, and a full acceptance/rejection workflow—making it a mini version of platforms like Upwork or Freelancer.
